# Crosspoint Reader - Flow

**Crosspoint Reader - Flow** is a high-performance, plugin-driven firmware for the **Xteink X4** e-paper display reader. This project is a heavily modified fork of [CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader), specifically optimized for the X4 hardware with expanded capabilities in reading, gaming, and extensibility.

Built using **PlatformIO** and targeting the **ESP32-C3** microcontroller.

### 11. System Intelligence

- **Reading Time Tracking**: The system automatically logs and calculates your reading duration for every book.
- **Smart Maintenance**: Automatic handling of reading records, metadata, and cache files to keep the system lean and responsive.

### 12. Core Performance

- **Memory Breakthrough**: 50% reduction in page table memory usage.
- **Instant Start**: Optimized refresh logic for near-instant book opening.

## 📂 SD Card Setup

To use the full features of the XTEINK X4 Flow, you must manually set up specific directories and files on your SD card. These files are not included in the firmware due to size constraints.

### 1. CJK Font Support

The system supports external font files for high-quality CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) rendering:

- **Requirement**: You must download the font `.bin` files (e.g., **Taipei Sans TC / 台北黑體**) and place them into the `/fonts/` directory on your SD card.
- **Reference**: Samples can be found in the `sdcard/fonts/` directory of this repository. Copy your preferred size (e.g., `TaipeiSansTC_30_30x31.bin`) to the SD card.

### 2. Lua Plugins

The integrated gaming and learning tools are powered by external scripts:

- **Requirement**: Download the plugin folders from this repository and manually place them into the `/plugins/` directory on your SD card.
- **Path**: Copy all subfolders from `sdcard/plugins/` to your SD card's root `/plugins/` folder.

### 3. Book Organization

For best compatibility and performance:

- **Recommended Path**: Place your eBook files (EPUB, XTC, TXT, MD) in a `/books/` subdirectory on the SD card.
- **Categorization**: You are encouraged to create subdirectories within `/books/` to organize your library (e.g., `/books/Fiction/`, `/books/Non-Fiction/`). The system will navigate these folders automatically.

## 🛠 Workflow: EPUB to XTC

To get the most out of the XTEINK X4, we recommend converting your EPUBs to XTC.
See the [EPUB to XTC Conversion Guide](../README.md#epub-轉檔-xtc-指南) in the root directory for the SOP.
